USAGE
To compile our code, run "make node" in the project directory. 
Running the compiled is as follows:
./node [config file name] [1 for router, 2 for host] [node ID]

In our case, "config file name" is config.txt. 
If you would like the node to be a router, the second argument should be 1.
If you would like the node to be a host, the second argument should be 2.
The third argument is this node's associated node ID as described in the config file.
